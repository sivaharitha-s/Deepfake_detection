        <h2>🔍 Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          DeepGuard AI is dedicated to identifying and preventing the spread of deepfake content. 
          Our goal is to build trust in digital media by providing accurate and fast deepfake detection 
          using advanced deep learning models.
        </p>

        <h2>🧠 What Are Deepfakes?</h2>
        <p>
          Deepfakes are synthetic media where a person’s likeness is digitally manipulated using AI, 
          often to make them appear to say or do things they never did. 
          While this technology can be used creatively, it also poses serious risks such as misinformation, 
          fraud, and privacy invasion.
        </p>

        <h2>⚙️ Our Technology</h2>
        <p>
          DeepGuard AI leverages state-of-the-art neural networks trained on thousands of real and fake faces. 
          The system analyzes subtle visual cues like inconsistencies in lighting, texture, and facial alignment 
          to accurately distinguish between authentic and manipulated images.
        </p>
